      <p>Hi! My name is Tony Bee. I'm 28 years old, and I was born and raised in Channahon,
        Illinois; a small town
        about 30 minutes south of Chicago. In high school I played football and enjoyed playing
        the guitar outside of
        school. I went to college at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, and studied
        Advertising.</p>
    <p>Upon graduating in 2012, I started working part-time at Baird & Warner Title Services.
        I've worked there the past
        6 years, working my way up as a part-time scanner to an underwriting and title examining
        position.
        In my free time I enjoy reading non-fiction, playing golf, long distance running, and
        exercise in general.</p>
    <p>I've always had and interest in coding and software development, and upon feeling stuck
        in my current work situation,
        I signed up for the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp to seek out other opportunities in the
        ever-expanding world of software.</p>
