    <p>Hi! my name is Tony Bee. I'm 28 years old, and I was born and raised in
    Channahon, Illinois; a small town about 30 minutes south of Chicago. I
    graduated from the University of Illinois in 2012 with a bachelor's degree
    in advertising. Upon graduation I began my professional career in the real
    estate industry at Baird & Warner Title Services, where over the past 7
    years I’ve worked my way up as a part time scanner, to a leader within the
    operations. I’ve recently spearheaded the development of a start-up title
    company within Baird & Warner, Starck Title Services; manning every phase of
    the operations.</p>

      <p>Upon feeling stuck in the real estate industry, I signed up for the
      Northwestern Full Stack Coding Bootcamp to pursue a career in the
      ever-expanding web development industry. I’m in love with the learning
      experience, and the feeling of accomplishment that comes with solving
      difficult problems that require critical thinking. My experience in the
      Bootcamp has fostered a newfound passion for coding and web development,
      and I look forward to a lifelong journey of learning in the field.</p>
